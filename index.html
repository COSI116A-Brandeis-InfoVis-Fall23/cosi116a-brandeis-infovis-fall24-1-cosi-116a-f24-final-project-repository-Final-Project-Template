    <h1>Project Team 3: Worldwide Trasportation Data, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Max Goldmuntz</strong>, <strong>Joshua Uhl</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by  <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman at </a> <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>We wanted to look at worldwide transportation data, and compare government spending with public transit quality. We wanted to do this partially because of the relatively poor public transportation in the United States. Normally, one would think that public transit quality would increase the wealthier people in a country are, but there seems to be less affluent nations with better systems than the US. As one of our group members in from Europe and has traveled extensively, we were curious as to why European transit networks are so far superior to others worldwide, and so wanted to check to see if it was because of the relative wealth of people who live in Europe, and the resulting hight amount spent on their transit networks.</em></p>
    
    <p><em> This made us want to explore whether having a higher GDP per capita results in an increae in public transportation quality. We assumed that with wealthier people, a nation would put more emphasis on public transit quality. The transit quality is measured as a number 1-7, and was received from an online data source. We wanted to track GDP per capita over total GDP because we thought it was more important to know how wealthy the people in the nation are, not the nation as a whole.</em></p>

    <p><em>We wanted to make a visualization that would show the raw data well, since much of what we are trying to explore is based on being able to see the spending and the score, and the percent spent on transit side by side. This became an issue in graphs and plots, as because the data points are so large, the difference doesn't show as well as we wanted it too. This is why we chose to include a table, as it solved all these issues. We innitially were going to use a world map as our second visualization, but we were not sure exactly how to include all three variables in that visualization, and we also wanted to make a visualization that would show the countries in relation to each other better because that was ultimately what we were exploring. We decided on the bubble chart because it would show the datapoints relationship well. We made a rough draft on Excel that turned out really well, and became the model for our final project. The rough draft included functionality that would let you sort the data by year, updating the data in the table and graph to any year selected. We wanted to include this in our final project as well because it allows the user the increased functionality of seing how an individual nations increase or decrease in GDP per capita has impacted their public transit quality. Ultimately, we believe our visualization links a table that holds country data on GDP per capita and public transit efficiency. <p><em>
  
    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>We got our data online from a few different datasets. Our data sources did match the problem statement as we got them from reputable sources. There was a lot of different places to find data from, but ultimately we could not find one comprehensive set that explored what we wanted to see. This was interesting, as we thought there would be a dataset already exploring our question, but we decided to continue on and make our own. We ended up combining two different datasets to make our master copy, integrating yearly GDP per capita data into the public transit score and percent spending dataset. The score is counted from 1-7, which was calculated by the source for us. We then made a python script that compiled the data properly so it could be shown in the table and chart properly. Originally, we tried to complete the project without this, but it became clear after seeing multible TA's and putting in a lot of effort that we were going to have to make the dataset perfectly formatted, or it would never result in a good final product. This part was extremely difficult, but without it our data would have been a mess, leading to issues with loading into the table and chart. With the compiled data, we made the table and chart, linked them, and added some more functionality such as displaying the year clicked on, and adding headers to the table. </em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>We identified four main tasks: gathering and preparing the data, displaying it in a table,  visualizing it in a bubble chart, and finally linking the two. Originally, we thought the most difficult of these tasks would be the brushing and linking, but that actually ended up beign by far the easiest. In the task table, we had the following domain tasks: How does transportation spending differ in different countries, how does transportation quality differ across countries, and how does population and geography impact what a country spends its transportation budget on. Looking at our three domain tasks, we decided they all were important, and so we wanted to try and include all the variables in our visualiization. :ooking at transit quality, as that was the premise of the entire project. Instead of looking at spending and population, we decided it would be better to just look at percent of GDP spent on transit budget. Finally, after everything was set up, we added the task of formatting, attempting to make the webpage and data presentation look good. Formatting the data was extremely difficult, as was the table, and even working with a TA for a while couldn't get it to work. It took a serious amount of time to compile the data neatly and have it show up on the webpage properly. </em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <div class="image-column">
      <img src="images/Josh-Vis.png" alt="Mockup Design 1" class="image">
      <p class="caption"><em>This is the original mockup design from Josh.</em></p>
      <img src="images/Max-Vis.png" alt="Mockup Design 2" style="transform: rotate(90deg); transform-origin: center; height: 150px; width: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">       <p class="caption"><em>This is the original mockup design from Max.</em></p>
      <img src="images/Excel-vis.png" alt="Excel Rough Draft" class="image">
      <p class="caption"><em>This is the original mockup design from our Excel model. It included the filter option, and worked very well.</em></p>
    </div>

  <p>The first two images are of our original mockup designs. Josh has the idea of doing a world map, with some kind of color coding to show transit quality in relation to GDP per capita. We couldn't think of a great way to show all three variables in this visualization, so we decided to move in another direction. We did really like the idea that Max had, combining both into a table to show the clear relationship between the two variables. We thought using a bubble chart would show the data in more detail and it would be easier to analyze at a glance. The third image is of our rough draft in Excel. The model we made in Excel was very usable, and we hoped that our final project would have the same functionality. Untimately, this hope came true as our final project looks even better than we expected. We included the Excel functionality, and even added a feature showing the year the user clicked on. All of the usability feedback we got was pretty good and did help us to improve, and we are really happy with the way our ideas evolved and where they ended up in the final product.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Overall, our group went through a lot of ups and downs when completing this project. We started with four group members, eventually ending up with only two left after half the group dropped the class. Our group first decided what kind of relationship we would want to examine, ultimately deciding on some kind of public transit based idea. We originally were going to look at domestic transit, but due to major issues regarding unequal government funding, population distribution, and difficulty tracking the variables on a state level lead to us deciding on a worldwide scope. We then found the data, combining two sources into one master dataset to be used. After that, we sketched our ideal visualizations, and talked about whos ideas we liked the best and what we wanted the final to look like. We then did a mock project in excel, which turned out really well and served as a model for our final project. Finally, we wrote the code for the final project, first working on the table, then the bubble chart, and finally linking them. We then did a lot of formatting work, making the bubble chart and table look pretty and clearly showing the brushing and linking. Given more time, I think we would hve liked to accomplish more functionality with the data, possibly adding a world map as well. But we are very happy with the effort we put into the project and the result we got out.</em></p>
