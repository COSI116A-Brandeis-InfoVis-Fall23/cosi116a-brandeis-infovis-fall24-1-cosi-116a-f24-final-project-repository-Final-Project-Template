    <h1>Project Team 18: Public Transportation, COSI 116A F24</h1>

    <p><strong>Jason Chen</strong>, <strong>Capo Wang</strong>, <strong>Tri Phan</strong>, <strong>Isaac
        Zygmuntowicz</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of user needs and motivating questions.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of the problem, and a reasonable response is
        proposed.</em></p>

    <p>After the global catastrophic public health crisis, the economic activities and people’s living habits have
      drastically shifted. One of the most affected parts is public transportation due to the social distancing practice
      many cities and countries implemented during the pandemic. This visualization utilizes the data of New York
      state’s public transportation data from the beginning of 2020 till today, and is dedicated to all the government
      public transportation offices to demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 alongside with the shift in people’s habits in
      the usage of public transportation. </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation
        slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very
        explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <p>The data for the heatmap came from two sources. Subway ridership true for subway ridership from July of 2020
      onward and Turnstile data for early 2020, for turnstile data that was converted into ridership data. This was done
      by subtracting the minimum entry value from the minimum of the previous day for each unit, ignoring negative
      values. Then, station names were converted to be consistent with the naming convention for the later data, and the
      two datasets were appended in excel.
      The data for the general ridership used in the bar and line chart came from
      https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew and required, no extra
      processing was necessary. </p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em>
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
        Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
        Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>

    <p>Our final visualization consists of three graphs which include a line chart, a bar chart, and a heat map. The
      initial dataset has data of different types of public transportation ridership in New York state daily from the
      beginning of 2020 till today. It provides two types of data which include the ridership number and the percentage
      of the current ridership compared to pre-COVID ridership. In order to better demonstrate the data in the dataset,
      we decide to make a line chart to show the trend of changing in ridership for public transportation; however,
      because the dominance of subway ridership in the dataset, if we put all different types of ridership data in line
      chart, some of the types of ridership will be almost unrecognizable. Therefore, we use the sum of all riderships
      for different types of public transportation. Hence, to show the different types of public transportation’s
      recovery and how much is affected by the COVID, we decided to add a bar chart to show the percentage of the
      current ridership compared to pre-COVID data. After we are finished with the main dataset, we decided that because
      we are making correlations between public transportation and COVID, we should add another line in the line chart
      demonstrating the current COVID cases in New York state to compare these two data for better observations. In
      addition, we want to show the shift in the interest in the usage of public transportation within New York city. In
      order to complete this task to show which part of the city still sticks to the habit of using public
      transportation after the COVID and which part chooses to use other ways of transportation, we make a heat map of
      New York city’s subway ridership by station. The choice of subway is due to the fact that although the usage of
      subway ridership declined dramatically after COVID hit, the total ridership of subway is still much larger than
      other types of public transportation combined together. In addition, the subway line also makes a very good
      looking visualization and can clearly demonstrate the different parts of the city in the usage of public
      transportation. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
