    <h1>Project Team 5: U.S. DoD Spending, COSI 116A F24</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Cooper Gottfried</strong>, <strong>Dean Carey</strong>, <strong>Adam Rieden</strong>, <strong>Garret Rieden</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>Initially, we were motivated to understand the scope and scale of government financial waste. 
      During our initial research, we came across public-facing examples of government spending that 
      we considered wasteful (i.e; <a href="https://www.farmlinkproject.org/stories-and-features/cheese-caves-and-food-surpluses-why-the-u-s-government-currently-stores-1-4-billion-lbs-of-cheese">government cheese caves</a>), and wanted to dig deeper into the anatomy 
      of government spending nationwide. To provide a basis for interesting analysis, we chose to break 
      spending down in two major ways: by state and by department. After exploring available resources, 
      we found that the Department of Defense (DoD) is, in nearly every U.S. state, one of the top spenders. 
      Given that the Department of Defense is often responsible for a significant portion of budgetary 
      waste (i.e; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html">leaving equipment behind after operations</a>), we chose to focus our visualization on 
      how much spending the Department of Defense is responsible for by state. Our data provides 
      interesting insights into the spending priorities of the U.S. government, and should spark 
      meaningful discussions about the massive military spending that has become routine in America. 
      By showing the dollar amount spent by the military, and the percentage of a state’s total 
      spending that takes up, we aim to provide a complete picture of the Department of Defense’s 
      impact on the U.S.’s budget.<br><br>
      </p><p>
      Motivating questions:
      <p>1. Where does the U.S. government spend the majority of its money?</p>
      <p>2. How does military spending compare to other major categories of spending?</p>
      <p>3. How does this comparison vary across states?</p>
      </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>There’s a few different components of our UI we’d like to talk about. First is the 
      brushing/linking between the table and the map. When an element is selected on one of 
      these, it becomes selected on the other. This is to provide more detailed information, 
      organized in a different fashion, about each state. It also allows users to understand 
      what the colors on this map actually mean. The legend on our map also aids users in understanding what they’re looking at.
      <br><br>Users may also use the “toggle colors” button to switch between a view of states organized by DoD% of state budget 
      (red) and the state’s DoD spending as a % of national DoD spending (gold). We find that these are both interesting data 
      points to consider, so we wanted to give our users the opportunity to swap fluidly between them.  
      <br><br>Each of these views, DoD % of state budget and state % of total DoD spending, had their colors
      chosen deliberately. We didn’t choose to use opposing colors (red and blue, for example),
      because we didn’t want to portray that more DoD spending is necessarily a bad thing. Instead,
      we chose to use high contrast colors (red and gold) so that the more highly-saturated colors
      stand out against the near-white ones. Additionally, red and gold as a color pair don’t carry
      much inherent political meaning within the United States, so any accidental bias from our viewer can be avoided.
      </p>

    <br>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>Our data comes from the U.S. government’s public repository of state-level spending data, 
      at <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/state">https://www.usaspending.gov/state</a>. 
      For each state, we filtered the data to be from January 1st, 2023 to December 31st, 2023. 
      Some states still had too many records to download, so we filtered the data to
      only include transactions over $250. We feel that both of these filters 
      ensure that our data is a representative sample of government spending over the course, 
      addressing data availability concerns without compromising on data validity. Once the 
      data was downloaded, we extracted the total outlayed amount for the Department of Defense 
      and the other three departments that spent the most in that state. This allowed us to create 
      a representative sample of the state’s total spending, as there was typically a large drop 
      off after the first few highest-spending departments. This process was repeated for each state, 
      and provided us with all the data we would need to complete our visualization. We put the total 
      outlayed amount for each state into Tableau to create the bar graphs necessary for our tooltips, 
      used the DoD’s spending to color in our heatmap, and used all of the data to create our table.
      <br><br>We chose not to include the spending data for every department that operated within each state. 
      By narrowing our focus to only the Department of Defense and the other top three departments, 
      we feel that we created a more easily understood (but still insightful) visualization.
      </p>

      <br>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>Our task table holds three tasks. By order of importance, the first task is to understand 
      how much money the government wastes per category. To categorize the government’s waste, we 
      broke spending down by department on a state level. We feel that, wherever the most spending 
      is within a state, the most waste also likely resides. So, in order to make insights into how 
      much money is being wasted by different government departments, we must first understand how 
      much they’re actually spending. This task’s key goals are to compare, lookup, and present 
      data. The second most important task is seeing categories of government spending. This is 
      completed during the pursuit of the aforementioned goal. To understand government waste, 
      we must first understand government spending. The goals of this task are to summarize, 
      explore, and discover data. Our third most important goal is to see what problems the 
      wasted money could address. This is addressed in our conclusion. The goal of this task is 
      to identify, browse, and discover the data. <br><br>While the first two tasks are essential to the 
      visualization itself, the third task is especially important to its interpretation. By 
      gaining an understanding of what the U.S. government could alternatively spend its budget 
      on, the spending choices it currently makes take on new meanings.
      </p>

      <br>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p>For our final visualization, the heat map is central. The more red a state is, the 
      higher the amount the Department of Defense spent in that state. We’ll have two view 
      present: one that shows the dollar amount spent by the Department of Defense in that 
      state, and one showing the percentage of total spending within the state that is 
      attributed to the Department of Defense. Combined, these will provide an accurate 
      picture of the Department’s spending nationwide. We’re using the color red to emphasize 
      the violent nature of many Department of Defense operations, and the gravity of the amount that they are spending.
      When a state is moused over, a tooltip will pop up, containing a blue bar graph 
      showing more information about the spending within the state. The corresponding 
      row in the table will also light up in blue. We chose to use blue to contrast with 
      the red of the heat map, drawing attention to the small details that we’re making available.
      <br><br>
      We've also added a second heat map, the gold one that can be seen when colors are toggled, to show the
      percentage of the DoD's total, national spending that happened in each state. We iterated on the colors, and the 
      transitions between them many times, and eventually settled on the slow transition between the two maps,
      and the use of another white-to-high-contrast-color gradient for the same reasons we mentioned above.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>Overall, we’re quite happy with how this project went. There were some difficulties with the heatmap, and 
      with overall formatting on the website, but we worked out the problems as we went on. We’re pleased with 
      the results we were able to show, happy about the overall quality of our visualization, and satisfied with 
      our work this semester. We feel that we accurately portrayed DoD spending, and showed the sheer scale of it on 
      a national level. While this has been done before, we feel that breaking it down by state was a somewhat novel approach.
      <br><br>We do, however, acknowledge that there’s certainly more to be done. In an ideal world, we would have been 
      able to investigate individual DoD contractors and possibly even display data on a county level instead of 
      a state level. By investigating individual DoD contractors, we think we would have found interesting patterns 
      about U.S. government spending, waste, and maybe even corruption. By breaking data down to the county level, 
      we may have been able to show even more interesting nationwide patterns. Still, though, we feel that 
      this visualization showcases our abilities, and our findings, quite well.
      <br><br>For future work, we would love to summarize what problems DoD spending could otherwise address. 
      Overall, the DoD spent $1,325,974,585,251 in 2023. That is a shocking high amount of money, and 
      it could be used to provide universal healthcare, solve homelessness, or otherwise address any 
      number of national problems. This is an ongoing, and well-publicized, topic that could be a full research project on its own.
