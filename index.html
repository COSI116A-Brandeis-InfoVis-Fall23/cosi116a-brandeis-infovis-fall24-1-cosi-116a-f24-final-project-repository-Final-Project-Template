    <h1><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>Federal expenditures provide a critical window into the government's priorities and responses to societal
        needs. From economic stabilization during recessions to investments in healthcare and education, understanding
        how resources are allocated is essential for informed policy discussions and public awareness. However, the
        complexity and sheer volume of federal budget data often hinder meaningful analysis.

        Our project addresses this gap by designing an interactive system that explores spending distribution trends,
        shifts in priorities during significant events, and the relative importance of key categories (e.g., defense,
        healthcare, education). By focusing on relative percentages rather than nominal values, we aim to highlight the
        proportional importance of each category while making shifts in priorities across time easily discernible.

        The primary motivating questions are:

        1. How has the relative distribution of federal spending evolved across categories over time?
        2. hat trends or shifts correspond to key historical events (e.g., economic crises, policy reforms)?
        3. How can percentages, rather than raw values, offer better insights into spending priorities?

        By answering these questions through an intuitive visualization, we empower users to analyze trends, uncover
        patterns, and derive insights into the evolving dynamics of federal expenditures.</em></p>

    <h1><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>The final visualization includes two key components: a stacked area chart and an interactive
        category-percentage table, each designed to highlight different aspects of U.S. federal expenditure trends. The
        stacked area chart provides a clear visual representation of how federal spending has changed over time across
        key categories such as National Defense, Social Security, Healthcare, and Education. This design was chosen to
        make trends and proportional shifts between categories evident, helping users easily identify periods of
        significant growth or decline. Each category is assigned a distinct, colorblind-friendly hue, with tooltip
        interactions that display precise dollar values for a selected year.

        The category-percentage table complements the chart by breaking down federal spending into percentages for a
        chosen timeframe, allowing for granular comparison. This table features sorting capabilities, enabling users to
        rank categories by spending amounts or proportional allocation. Together, these tools provide a cohesive
        narrative about federal expenditure priorities, facilitating both high-level overviews and detailed analyses.

        The interface encourages exploration through interactivity. Users can hover and drag over the stacked area chart
        to examine spending for any specific years or use filters in the table to narrow down data to categories of
        interest. By combining interactivity with clarity, the visualizations ensure accessibility for both experts and
        non-experts.</em></p>

    <h1><i class="fas fa-database"></i> Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>The dataset comprises historical U.S. federal expenditure data from 1964 to 2017, detailing spending across
        major government functions, including Healthcare, National Defense, and Education, with amounts measured in
        billions of USD. This data, sourced from official budget archives published by the Obama administration, is
        highly reliable and was validated by cross-referencing Congressional Budget Office reports to ensure its
        accuracy. The dataset is organized annually, enabling analysis of how federal priorities and budget allocations
        have evolved over time.

        Preprocessing steps focused on refining the dataset for clarity and usability. First, anomalous data categories,
        such as "offsetting receipts" (which represent negative values or inflows to the government), were removed.
        These were deemed irrelevant to the analysis since they represented small portions of the budget and could
        distort overall spending trends. The analysis also involved selecting only the total spending values for each
        major category, ensuring a balance between detail and simplicity. This decision was made to avoid an overly
        complex table that would include too many subcategories. To facilitate comparisons over time, all nominal
        figures were converted into percentages of total spending for each year. This transformation helps users better
        assess trends and identify shifts in spending priorities without being distracted by the impact of inflation.

        The data includes the following types:

        1. Quantitative: Expenditure values in billions or millions, providing insight into the scale of government
        spending.
        2. Categorical: Different spending categories such as Healthcare, National Defense, and Education.
        3. Quantitative (ordinal): Years, which are treated as sequential data to track changes in spending over time.
        By focusing on these core elements, the dataset allows for in-depth analysis of long-term trends, such as the
        steady increase in mandatory program spending like Social Security, as well as shifts in discretionary spending
        during economic crises. This well-organized dataset not only provides valuable insights into past federal
        spending but also serves as a reproducible foundation for future research.</em></p>

    <h1><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>The task analysis focuses on four key domain tasks, each addressing a specific aspect of analyzing U.S.
        federal expenditure data. These tasks are structured to provide insights into spending trends, priorities, and
        their relationship with economic conditions.

        1. Examine Expenditure Changes Over Time: The goal of this task is to track how federal expenditure in specific
        categories (e.g., healthcare, defense) has changed over the years. By filtering and sorting the data, the
        analysis identifies trends and key shifts in expenditure patterns. This task aims to uncover which categories
        have seen the most significant increases or decreases, providing a clear view of how government priorities
        evolve. The underlying process is to observe how federal spending adapts to changing needs and priorities over
        time.

        2. Investigate Correlations Between Expenditure and Economic Performance: This task focuses on understanding how
        changes in federal spending in specific categories correlate with broader economic indicators such as GDP growth
        or unemployment rates. The goal is to assess whether increases or decreases in federal expenditure influence
        economic performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of spending in driving economic outcomes. This
        task involves filtering the data to focus on relevant years and economic factors, and then analyzing patterns to
        uncover potential causal relationships between federal spending and economic performance.

        3. Analyze Spending Distribution in a Given Year: The objective of this task is to examine how federal spending
        is distributed across different categories in a specific year. By filtering and sorting the data, the analysis
        identifies the areas with the highest and lowest expenditures, shedding light on the government's priorities for
        that year. The goal is to understand the relative importance of various categories, and comparing the
        distribution across multiple years helps identify shifts in policy priorities.

        4. Review Shifts in Spending During Significant Events: This task investigates how federal spending priorities
        shift in response to significant events such as financial crises or public health emergencies. By filtering the
        data to focus on these periods, the analysis identifies anomalies or drastic changes in spending. The goal is to
        understand how external events influence federal budget allocations and to compare these shifts across different
        events to identify patterns in governmental response to crises.

        Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing federal spending data, helping to identify
        trends, correlations, and policy shifts over time.</em></p>

    <p><em>The design process for the federal expenditure visualization started with initial hand-drawn sketches,
        focusing on representing nominal spending data in a stacked bar chart format, alongside a table displaying each
        year's total spending. The goal at this stage was to provide a clear, high-level view of federal spending across
        multiple categories over time. However, upon reviewing the initial sketches, it became clear that simply showing
        nominal spending over the years didn't reveal any meaningful trends because all categories were increasing. This
        made it difficult to distinguish how specific categories were growing or changing over time.

        Upon transitioning to digital prototypes, we chose a stacked area chart to represent the data, thinking it would
        provide a cleaner view of expenditure trends over time. However, this approach also fell short, as the increase
        in all categories caused the graph to appear overly cluttered, with no distinct trends emerging. Feedback from
        usability testing indicated that users found it challenging to discern any significant insights from the chart.
        This highlighted the need for further refinement.

        To improve the clarity and usefulness of the visualization, we made several critical design decisions grounded
        in principles from design theory. First, we removed "offsetting receipts" from the dataset. These inflows,
        though part of the budget, were negative and did not contribute to actual government spending. Their removal
        helped reduce noise in the visualization and allowed the main expenditure categories to be the focus.

        Next, we transformed the data from nominal values to percentages. This decision was rooted in the idea of
        data-ink ratio, which emphasizes the importance of minimizing non-data elements to enhance clarity. By
        converting spending figures into percentages, we provided users with a more intuitive way to compare changes
        across categories over time, regardless of the overall increase in government spending. This approach aligned
        with the Gestalt principles of proximity and similarity, ensuring that trends could be identified based on
        relative proportions rather than raw numbers.

        Additionally, usability feedback highlighted the importance of interactivity, leading us to introduce features
        like tooltips and year-based filtering. These changes were designed to allow users to dive deeper into specific
        data points and analyze trends in a more granular way. Overall, each iteration of the design addressed specific
        usability concerns and refined the visualization to provide a clearer, more meaningful exploration of federal
        expenditure data.

        In conclusion, the design process was a dynamic, iterative journey guided by usability testing and design theory
        principles. Each modification was made with the goal of improving clarity and enhancing the user experience. The
        final visualization provides an accessible and informative representation of U.S. federal expenditure trends,
        and future improvements will continue to build on this foundation..</em></p>

    <h1><i class="fas fa-flag-checkered"></i> Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>This analysis provided a comprehensive examination of federal expenditure trends, focusing on the key areas
        of defense, healthcare, social security, and education. By analyzing data over multiple decades, we identified
        notable shifts in how the federal government allocates resources and the evolving nature of these expenditures.
        For instance, defense spending has consistently formed a significant portion of the federal budget, but
        healthcare and social security spending have seen substantial increases as the population ages and healthcare
        costs rise. Education spending, while growing, has been more stable in comparison, highlighting a potential area
        for future focus.

        The key takeaway from this analysis is the disproportionate growth in entitlement programs like Medicare,
        Medicaid, and Social Security. These programs now account for a substantial portion of federal spending,
        reflecting demographic changes such as an aging population and the expansion of healthcare needs. While these
        programs provide critical support to millions of Americans, their rapid expansion poses a challenge to long-term
        fiscal sustainability. Additionally, the overall federal expenditure growth raises questions about the
        efficiency and effectiveness of spending in certain sectors.

        Looking ahead, future work should focus on refining the analysis by integrating policy changes and their effects
        on expenditure trends. For example, the impact of healthcare reforms or tax policy changes on the federal budget
        could offer valuable insights into the dynamics of spending and revenue generation. Furthermore, exploring the
        long-term fiscal impact of the increasing proportion of entitlement spending could help policymakers understand
        the sustainability of these programs. Additionally, it would be valuable to expand the scope to include
        state-level expenditure trends and how they interact with federal spending. This would provide a more holistic
        view of the government's financial health and guide future decisions on public policy and budgeting.

        By incorporating these additional analyses, the project could yield a more thorough understanding of not just
        where federal money is going today, but also where it is likely to go in the future, and what strategies could
        help manage the fiscal challenges ahead.</em></p>
