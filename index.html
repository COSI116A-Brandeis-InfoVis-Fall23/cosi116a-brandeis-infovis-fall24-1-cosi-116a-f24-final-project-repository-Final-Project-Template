    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>After the global catastrophic public health crisis, the economic activities and people’s living habits have
      drastically shifted. One of the most affected parts is public transportation due to the social distancing practice
      many cities and countries implemented during the pandemic. This visualization utilizes the data of New York
      state’s public transportation data from the beginning of 2020 till today, and is dedicated to all the government
      public transportation offices to demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 alongside with the shift in people’s habits in
      the usage of public transportation. </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation

    <img src="images/1.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>Our final visualization is made with a combination of three visualizations, a heat map showing the subway
      ridership from March 2020 to October 2024, a line chart showing the public transportation ridership and COVID
      cases in New York from March 2020 to October 2024, a barchart showing the different types of transportation in New
      York as percentage in comparison to pre-COVID era. When clicking on the different types of transportation on the
      barchart, the corresponding line with the same color as the bar will be shown on the line chart to give the clear
      presentation of the impact of COVID crisis on that chosen type of transportation. </p>

    <img src="images/2.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>When selecting and brushing the points on the line chart, the selected points will be highlighted as red and the
      barchart will reflect the average percentage of various types of public transportation over that period of time.
      In addition, the heatmap will also reflect that time period of subway ridership. Meanwhile, the selected period
      will also show its detailed time on the line chart. </p>

    <img src="images/3.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <img src="images/4.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>On the above graph, we can see that when hovering over a station point on the heatmap, the detailed data will
      show on the graph. In addition, when clicking or brushing over a single point on the line chart, the detailed data
      will also be displayed on the graph. </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <p>The data for the heatmap came from two sources. Subway ridership true for subway ridership from July of 2020
      onward and Turnstile data for early 2020, for turnstile data that was converted into ridership data. This was done
      by subtracting the minimum entry value from the minimum of the previous day for each unit, ignoring negative
      values. Then, station names were converted to be consistent with the naming convention for the later data, and the
      two datasets were appended in excel.
      The data for the general ridership used in the bar and line chart came from
      https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew and required, no extra
      processing was necessary. </p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>Our domain task is to show ridership of public transportation changes over time, show ridership of subway in a
      heat map, show ridership change over time and compare to covid stats, breakdown rider demographics. We decided to
      primarily use our visualization to present the data around our tasks with potential to discover meaningful
      insight. With the heatmap, we are able to show the ridership usage, especially the subway ridership, in New York
      city over the past 4 years of COVID and the location where the subway is mainly used which fulfill our task of
      showing the ridership of subway and rider demographics. With the line chart, we are able to show the ridership
      changes of public transportation usage over the past 4 years and with the line of COVID cases in New York over the
      past 4 years, the task of presenting and exploring the relationship between the trend of public transportation and
      public health crisis. The barchart was not initially aligned with our previous goal and task specifically;
      however, it is designed to show more clear compare and contrast of the usage of public transportation with
      pre-COVID time. Overall, all three visualizations in combination give a comprehensive presentation of our data and
      are aligned with our domain tasks.
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p>Our final visualization consists of three graphs which include a line chart, a bar chart, and a heat map. The
      initial dataset has data of different types of public transportation ridership in New York state daily from the
      beginning of 2020 till today. It provides two types of data which include the ridership number and the percentage
      of the current ridership compared to pre-COVID ridership. In order to better demonstrate the data in the dataset,
      we decide to make a line chart to show the trend of changing in ridership for public transportation; however,
      because the dominance of subway ridership in the dataset, if we put all different types of ridership data in line
      chart, some of the types of ridership will be almost unrecognizable. Therefore, we use the sum of all riderships
      for different types of public transportation. Hence, to show the different types of public transportation’s
      recovery and how much is affected by the COVID, we decided to add a bar chart to show the percentage of the
      current ridership compared to pre-COVID data. After we are finished with the main dataset, we decided that because
      we are making correlations between public transportation and COVID, we should add another line in the line chart
      demonstrating the current COVID cases in New York state to compare these two data for better observations. In
      addition, we want to show the shift in the interest in the usage of public transportation within New York city. In
      order to complete this task to show which part of the city still sticks to the habit of using public
      transportation after the COVID and which part chooses to use other ways of transportation, we make a heat map of
      New York city’s subway ridership by station. The choice of subway is due to the fact that although the usage of
      subway ridership declined dramatically after COVID hit, the total ridership of subway is still much larger than
      other types of public transportation combined together. In addition, the subway line also makes a very good
      looking visualization and can clearly demonstrate the different parts of the city in the usage of public
      transportation. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>For this project, we have done the three visualizations, one heat map, one line chart, and one bar chart as we
      expected. The combination of these visualizations clearly shows the outbreak of COVID significantly impacts the
      overall usage of public transportation especially for a huge city with well-built infrastructure like New York. We
      believe our project can give meaningful insight for the transportation department in government about the future
      development of public transportation. They would be able to decide which type of transportation should be more
      developed. To further develop our project in a more meaningful way, we can incorporate the living standard of
      residents such as incomes, housing price, and accessibility of public transportations to further the understanding
      of who actually uses public transportation. We can see even during the apex of COVID crisis, who still stick to
      public transportation and who find the supplement way of transportation themselves. In addition, because public
      transportation is such a convenient way of living and such a complex and comprehensive matter, we can also examine
      more potential aspects that affect it such as, how many tourists are actually contributing to the usage and how
      many changes in politics and other aspects affect its usage. Thus, more meaningful visualizations and more
      meaningful insights would be made thereafter.</p>
