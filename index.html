    <p><strong>Gina Jin</strong>, <strong>Madison Holmes</strong>, <strong>Jasmine Huang</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>Boston MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) is the public transportation system in the Boston area, encompassing buses, subways, and trains. The subway system, commonly referred to as "the T," serves as a vital mode of commute 
      for many residents and visitors but is notorious for frequent delays and slow service. This project is motivated by the need to address user frustrations with the system by analyzing delays at each station across different lines to understand 
      the extent of disruptions. A key focus is identifying the primary causes of these delays, such as maintenance issues, technical failures, or other disruptions, by examining the most common alerts. Additionally, this project aims to help users by 
      providing insights into the busiest travel times at specific stations, enabling them to avoid overcrowding. By offering predictions about potential delays based on historical trends and real-time data, commuters can make more informed decisions 
      about whether to use the subway or alternative transit options. This project seeks to enhance the commuting experience by equipping users with actionable information to plan their journeys more efficiently.</p>

    <p>Our visualization is designed for "present" consumption, helping users make timely decisions about their use of the MBTA system. The MBTA graph displays the Green, Red, Orange, and Blue lines, with interactive features for deeper insights. Users can hover over a station to view average delay times and the most common alerts, providing a quick understanding of reliability and delay causes. By clicking on a line, a heatmap table appears, showing ridership levels and peak travel times across all stations. Additionally, users can drag to highlight a series of stations, allowing them to focus on specific routes for personalized insights.</p> <br>

<p>The design prioritizes clarity, interactivity, and usability to help users plan their travel effectively. The hover and click interactions enable a seamless exploration of data without clutter, while the heatmap uses color intensity to highlight key trends like high ridership and peak hours. This approach not only helps users identify patterns and delays but also provides actionable insights to plan alternate routes or adjust travel times. By balancing simplicity with depth, the visualization supports smarter decision-making and improves user understanding of MBTA reliability.</p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>We had to develop a series of Python scripts to clean, transform, and prepare MBTA subway stop data for this visualization. First, we processed raw MBTA stop data by removing duplicates, standardizing stop names, and merging it with a station ID mapping from a secondary file containing stop distances and IDs. This step resulted in a cleaner dataset with unique stop names, line information, and station IDs, forming the foundation for further analysis.

      To accurately map stops, we converted latitude and longitude coordinates into UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates using the utm library. A linear transformation was then applied using scipy.optimize.curve_fit to align these UTM coordinates with an existing JSON coordinate system used for visualizing the stops. This transformation enabled us to integrate our cleaned data with the existing visualization framework quite seamlessly.
      
      We added in all the green line info because the MBTAVIS.github.io didnâ€™t have it. We implemented an interactive mapping tool using Matplotlib. We overlayed the actual MBTA and had to go in about 3 times and click each individual stop on the subway map image to record the X and Y positions for each. The tool dynamically updated the dataset, saving progress after each recorded point to ensure no data was lost. Stops were processed in order, sorted by route_id and longitude to streamline the workflow.
      
      Finally, we generated a JSON file representing the MBTA subway network. Using the cleaned stop data, the script created nodes for each station, containing station IDs and names, and links representing connections between stops, complete with line types and corresponding colors. This structured JSON file was essential for visualizing the subway system on our website, ensuring accurate representation of the stations, routes, and connections.
      
      Together, these scripts completely automated the transformation of raw MBTA data into a clean, organized, and visualization-ready format!!</p>

        <li>Alternative Transit Insights: Assist users in determining when to consider alternative travel methods based on the severity and frequency of delays.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Processes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users interact with a visual map of the subway lines and stations to retrieve historical data.</li>
        <li>The system aggregates and displays data in an accessible format like pop-ups or adjacent tables.</li>
        <li>Users can toggle between weekday and weekend data to customize their experience based on the day of travel.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide actionable insights that enable users to make informed travel decisions to help them reduce time spent waiting 
          for delayed trains. Also offers clear, concise visualizations to enhance usability , and addressed the variability in travel 
          patterns between weekdays and weekends.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p> Our visualization utilizes a map to represent the MBTA subway lines, with each line color-coded according to its official MBTA color scheme (e.g., Red Line, Orange Line), ensuring an intuitive and familiar design for users.
       The map is linked to a detailed table that uses a heatmap-style color gradient to display passenger flow and delays, where darker colors indicate higher passenger volume or more significant delays.This dual-layered approach allows 
       users to visually interpret patterns in subway usage and delays with ease. Initially, the map design featured uniform dot sizes for all stations, with detailed passenger flow and delay data only accessible through the linked table.
       However, after peer reviews and usability testing, we made significant enhancements to the map. In the updated version, stations are represented with variable-sized dots, where larger dots indicate busier stations with higher delays. 
       This improvement integrates key insights directly into the map, enabling users to understand subway congestion and delays at a glance without needing to cross-reference the table. These design choices are grounded in visualization theory, 
       leveraging color and size as intuitive indicators of magnitude, and demonstrate iterative improvement based on user feedback to create a more effective and user-friendly tool. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion HERE:</h1>

    <p>The impact of this project lies in its ability to provide commuters with a powerful tool for navigating the using the MBTA subway system. By offering gathered data into delays, station crowding, and peak travel times, this tool empowers 
      users to make informed decisions about their transit options, reducing frustration and saving time. The color-coded map, linked table, and dynamic visualizations create a cohesive interface that simplifies complex data for everyday users. 
      Potential future usage of this tool extends beyond individual commuters to benefit urban planners and MBTA operators. The data can highlight patterns of congestion and inform infrastructure investments or schedule adjustments. 
      Policymakers can leverage these to advocate for targeted funding or improvements in underperforming stations. MBTA operators can use the analytics to identify frequent delay causes and optimize operations to improve efficiency and reliability. 
      Essentically, the tool could help users anticipate delays and crowding based on historical trends, while expanding to include data from other transit modes like buses and commuter rail. A mobile-friendly version could make the tool even more accessible,
      providing on-the-go insights to commuters. This project addresses existing gaps in transit transparency but also has the potential to enhance how public transportation data is used for long-term system optimization and commuter satisfaction.
